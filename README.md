### About

I currently have no job and I am a hobbyist developer.

My Discord account: Hri7566#3409

If you would like to talk, you can contact me on Discord. You can try my gmail or Twitter, but I don't check those as often.

I'm a contributor and core member of MPPClone/Multiplayer Piano and have created many scripts and projects centered around it.

My real name is not listed here because I use this account in public view of strange people.
