I'm Hri7566. You probably either know me very well
or hate me a lot, and if you're not someone I know, you must be lost.
I'm from a crazy dumpster fire called <a href="https://multiplayerpiano.com">MPP</a>.
At the moment of writing, MPP is completely offline. At this time, I'm
the best programmer I've ever been: I'm making large scale projects,
starting not to host from home, learning what not to do from higher ups,
and it's been a lot of fun. If you know me from Discord, well, if you 
didn't know already, I'm a (terrible) programmer.

Here's an invitation to my [fishing Discord server](https://discord.gg/yBdmPKag).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a setup for streaming on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/hri7566).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python for my CS course.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any casual web projects (please let me involve humor).
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with transitioning from Node.js to C++.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about [Brandon's Fishing Bot](https://github.com/multiplayerpiano/fishing-bot)!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: My Discord tag is **Hri7566#3409** and my Twitter handle is **[@Hri7566](https://twitter.com/hri7566)**.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been programming for six years.
