I'm Hri7566. I currently have no job and I am a hobbyist developer.
Sometimes I like to mess with VRChat and make some melonloader mods with some people.

I am what you call a full-stack developer.

If there's anything I don't know yet, I usually learn subjects within a week.

Here's an invitation to my [fishing Discord server](https://discord.gg/yBdmPKag).
My Discord account: Hri7566#3409
