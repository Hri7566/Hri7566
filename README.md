### Hi there 👋

I'm Hri7566. I make Node.js projects and I hang out on [Multiplayer Piano](https://www.multiplayerpiano.com). Usually, I'm in a room with the name "✧𝓡𝓟 𝓡𝓸𝓸𝓶✧" (nobody roleplays, trust me).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ~~[7566](https://github.com/Hri7566/bot-server)~~ a replacement for the MPP crown holder, Bouncer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ~~**Node.js**~~ TypeScript.
- 👯 I’m looking to ~~collaborate on **Node.js** projects~~ collaborate on MPP scripts.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with WebSockets in Deno.
- 💬 Ask me about [Multiplayer Piano](https://www.multiplayerpiano.com) I'm not available to answer questions.
- 📫 How to reach me: My Discord tag is **Hri7566#3409**, and my Twitter handle is **@Hri7566**.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've only been programming in JavaScript for two years.
