UPDATE: I've started to move to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Hri7566).

I'm Hri7566. I make Node.js projects ~~and I hang out on [Multiplayer Piano](https://www.multiplayerpiano.com). Usually, I'm in a room with the name "✧𝓡𝓟 𝓡𝓸𝓸𝓶✧" (nobody roleplays there, they've been moved to "The Roleplay Room")~~. R.I.P. Multiplayer Piano 2012-2021
