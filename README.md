I'm Hri7566.
Sometimes I like to play VRChat (when I'm not banned).
I'm from a crazy dumpster fire called <a href="https://multiplayerpiano.com">MPP</a>. At this time, I'm
the worst programmer I've ever been: I'm coming up with terrible ideas, having others talk down on me.
If you know me from Discord, well, if you couldn't figure it out already, I'm a programmer.

Here's an invitation to my [fishing Discord server](https://discord.gg/yBdmPKag).
