### About
I currently have no job and I am a hobbyist developer.
I learned JavaScript over the span of a week helping someone with a tampermonkey script, and I've been trying to master the art of it for years.

My goal is to become a full-stack developer.

If there's anything I don't know yet, I usually learn subjects within a week.

Here's an invitation to my [fishing Discord server](https://discord.gg/yBdmPKag).
