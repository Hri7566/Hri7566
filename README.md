### Hi there 👋

I'm Hri7566. I make Node.js projects and I hang out on [Multiplayer Piano](https://www.multiplayerpiano.com). Usually, I'm in a room with the name "✧𝓡𝓟 𝓡𝓸𝓸𝓶✧" (nobody roleplays, trust me).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ~~[7566](https://github.com/Hri7566/bot-server)~~ a replacement for the MPP crown holder, Bouncer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ~~**Node.js**~~ nothing..
- 👯 ~~I’m looking to collaborate on **Node.js** projects~~ I can't collaborate on anything.
- 🤔 ~~I’m looking for help with Websockets in **C++** or **C#**~~ I don't need help with anything.
- 💬 ~~Ask me about [Multiplayer Piano](https://www.multiplayerpiano.com)~~ I'm not available to answer questions.
- 📫 How to reach me: ~~My Discord tag is **Hri7566#3409**, and my Twitter handle is **@Hri7566**~~ Don't talk to me.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: ~~I'm only 17!~~ My four years of hard work have gone to waste!
