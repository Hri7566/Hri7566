### About my programming

I grew up with computers, and, like a lot of others, they're one of my favorite things. I used my dad's 2002 iMac G4 to play stuff like Marble Blast and Otto Matic and use Firefox to browse PBS Kids.

When I was in grade school, I was looking for a reason to become someone cool, like everyone does. I poked around with C a little bit, but it was a terrible place to start and I didn't like it very much. I wanted to learn how to do stuff like make Minecraft mods or make a game, but these projects were definitely way over my head and I didn't even know what Unity was, let alone ever seen a snippit of code.

Around 7th or 8th grade (2015), I found people on YouTube playing this game called Mari0, where you play through Super Mario Bros. with a portal gun. I downloaded the game and played it for hours on end wondering how someone was able to pull this off. Eventually, I learned about how it was made and I looked into https://love2d.org and started to learn how to program in Lua. This also lead me into Roblox games, but i never got that far there.

In September 2018, I met some cool people on MPP who were running some browser-based chat bots and I wanted to be like them. Soon afterwards, I found myself collaborating on someone else's script, and I picked up some scripting skills as I went along. Eventually, I started work on my own bot and it was just as bad and just as long as everyone else's.

Sometime in early 2019, the "someone else" that I helped had moved from Tampermonkey to NodeJS on Heroku, and I learned how to use git. I moved my bot to NodeJS as well (though not on Heroku), and then something terrible happened...

About a week after my bot was ported, my friend's computer died, so we could no longer work together on his script. I inherited some parts of his bot (with permission, of course) and started to fledge out my bot. Sometime in late 2019, a user by the name of [BopItFreak](https://github.com/BopItFreak) threw some old code at me without telling me why. I studied it long and hard, and this was my introduction to object-oriented programming. After that point, I rewrote my bot and it started to get genuinely good features, such as cursor animation modes and user data storage (some of it *might* have been stolen from bop it at one point, but I was learning!).

In November 2020, I rewrote my bot again and now it's completely cross-compatible with MPP and Discord and also released https://hri7566.info/mpp (now replaced with https://mpp.hri7566.info).

### What 2020 was like for me

As we all know, 2020 was a disaster. Everything that could've gone wrong definitely went wrong.

I wasn't affected until March, like most people, when school shut down in most of the United States. At the time, I was a Junior in high school and we had just switched classes about a month beforehand. In the previous semester, I took both US History 1 and 2 at the same time, so I had to do twice the current event work, which means CNN 10 twice a day. In December, I noticed things started to gain speed in Wuhan right after the protests in Hong Kong.

Anyway, we switched classes, and everything was okay until March, like I said. Here's the line of events throughout a week and a half of March:
 - Monday: Normal school day
 - Tuesday: Normal school day
 - Wednesday: News that corona was spreading in Europe
 - Thursday: News that it was in the US
 - Friday: Something is wrong, teachers are worried about what the next couple days might be like
 - Saturday: News that it was most definitely in my state
 - Sunday: Announcement for some school closings
 - Monday: Pack your stuff and clean your lockers, and you're taking this chromebook home if you need it
 - Tuesday: Okay, no school for a couple months
 - Wednesday: No school for the rest of time until we can figure this out

By the end of March, everyone knew we weren't going back for the rest of the school year.

My grades dropped somewhat, but I was able to turn out okay in the end when June came around. I enjoyed July at home, like I usually do, and then it was August, a few storms were on their way, namely two hurricanes. My driver's test, on August 4th (my birthday), had been cancelled because of the constant rain with perfect timing. Other than that, my birthday a rather relaxing day.

And then it happened.

On August 7th, 2020, a very evil storm was coming. I woke up at around 5:30 PM after staying up until about 8 AM beforehand (don't ask), and I was playing some Animal Crossing until around 6:00 PM, when I went out in the kitchen and grabbed some cereal. My dad was watching TV and hadn't eaten because his teeth were sore and he didn't want to hurt himself too much, and he wasn't that hungry anyway. At 6:30 PM, large gusts of wind were raging through my backyard and the trees were - as my dad put it - hula dancing. We decided to shuffle into the basement, and so I grabbed my dog and my dad *didn't* grab the cat and we hid from the storm. After about 15 minutes or so, the power went out, but, you know, that's no big deal, we'll just wait and call the electric company once everything settles down or whatever. Then the lightning was getting louder, some of the strikes being *very* close by, and we were starting to worry a bit, but everything was still fine.

And then- all of the sudden-

A concerningly loud *snap* followed by a *really* concerningly loud crashing sound came from outside and quickly made its way inside.

And then a couple more snaps.

And then another crash.

That was not lightning. That had to have been something falling on the house... but it couldn't have been that bad, right? Just a tree limb or something, right?

That night, six trees fell on my house.

My dad went upstairs and carefully looked around until I surprisingly heard him yell "HOLY **^&!@**" followed by "**WHAT THE #@!^?**", then another comfirming "***WHAT THE &!%^!***". I knew something was wrong. My dad called emergency services, then came back down in the basement to grab a staple gun and a ladder.

He went to staple a tarp to the roof.

Meanwhile, I called my mom and let her know what happened, which my dad didn't do.

The people who live across the street from me have ties with the local fire department, so they came over to check on us, and I carefully answered the door and they called the fire department, then I went back into the basement with my dog.

About 20 minutes later, fire trucks arive (though you couldn't see them from the house because of the two other trees in our driveway) and the fire cheif bangs on the door. I come up to answer the door and my dad comes down the ladder on the front porch (right next to the door) because he ran out of staples. The fire cheif wouldn't let me go back in for my dog (still in the basement), but my dad righteously *insisted* that we needed the dog, so, despite the fire cheif's threat to arrest him, he went in anyway. He was not arrested.

We ended up going across the street to the people from earlier's house and we sat on their back porch for a while and made some phonecalls to alert some people, and at this point it's about 7:30 PM. We end up meeting a lady from the municipal building who deals with all of the things when people's houses get wrecked, and she gave us a card and told us she would be on our side about the whole thing and whatever.

After another 15 minutes or so my mom called me back and let us know that she was one street away, and the fire department blocked the road off and wouldn't let her in, despite her showing them pictures that we sent her.

I walked down my street with my dog in my arms in my pajamas in the middle of a thunderstorm.

Around halfway down the road, I found my mom (without her car) along with an old friend from school. We started walking back to give the dog back and reunite and whatever until about halfway back, where we find my dad. He yells about how she's supposed to have the car and whatever as if his house was just wrecked or something, and we walk all the way back to where she parked and bring the car back.

The lady from earlier and some other people grabbed some of our belongings and threw them into some bags (that I got out while I was waiting for them to arrive before we were pulled out of the house) and they loaded them into the car. We called a close family friend and since his wife was away until the next day, we stayed there and some heavy drinking occurred and whatever.

The next day, we booked a hotel for a week (my dad thought this was too long), called a tree service, and found an insurance adjuster. For the two weeks or so, we looked around for suitable temporary housing and furniture to go with it. We also got a cleaning company to come and clean the house, then fired them after the first week after realizing they were ripping us off and grabbed another one who did the job in about another week (whereas the first company did almost nothing), and we also got some roofers to put up some temporary roofing for ceiling that was on my dad's bed. During this time, I made [pong](https://github.com/Hri7566/pong) and started space invaders, but ultimately never finished it. I also started my senior year of high school, completely remote.

We ended up staying in the hotel for a month and a half until the trailer was delivered.

Around halfway through September, we got electricity hooked back up and we didn't have internet access for a little less than a day (the fibreoptic cable crushed our mailbox during the storm), and then we ended up getting a plan with the best upload speed ever, otherwise known as 5 Mb/s with 200 Mb/s download.

Throughout October things were okay, I got back together with my ex, and things were overall good, except Halloween was a little underwhelming. November was mostly the same up until about a week before Thanksgiving, when my school went back in person.

We shut down after Thanksgiving break (one week later).

Towards the end of November, my dog was getting noticeably sicker (he had cancer since 2018 or so, and was still on chemo). In the start of December, he wasn't eating and he was barely drinking, and sadly, he ended up passing away on December 4th.

My great uncle broke his arm on Christmas.

New Year's Eve comes up, and I spend the night at my girlfriend's house. On January 3rd, I went to spend time with her again, but I got into a fight with my parents. They ended up taking literally ***EVERY PIECE OF TECH IN MY ROOM***, even the *running* Raspberry Pi 4 on my side table.

Now it's the end of January, and my grades have dropped *considerably* since September like a lot of other people, and grades are due at the end of next week. Wish me luck.

### Update 2/6/2021

Alright, it's the beginning of February. My gf is in Virginia with her sister, and we tell each other that we miss each other every ten minutes or so.

School's starting to pick up speed. We're supposed to go back in March, so they're trying to get us back to the usual schedule and not doing whatever during school time, they want to make sure we're online and not destroying our stomachs and sleep schedules and stuff. One of my classes is in Zoom instead of MS Teams and my teachers are having huge issues with it. They blamed it on MS Teams, but since it was their decision to use zoom...

Anyway, I promised my guidance counselor that I would try my best in AP Calc and bring my grade up so that I can try to get that associate's degree, which would be REALLY helpful because I can just skip two years of BS in college.

Today, I'm also going to check out my brother Eric's new house, which is gonna be fun. We're bringing camping chairs and we're going to Rexy's Pizza to bring him his favorite pizza. My mom also has some of his old stuff that he left here almost twenty years ago.

### Update 2/11/2021

I can't stand not being able to see my gf.

Last night, I started work on https://mpp.hri7566.info, but it doesn't work.
